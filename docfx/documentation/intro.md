# Juhta.NET Introduction

------------------------

Juhta.NET is an open-source, general-purpose application framework built on the top of .NET Core 2 and .NET Standard 2 (or later). Juhta.NET is licensed under the MIT License.

The basic idea of Juhta.NET is to provide a modular approach for the application development. You just choose those modules suitable for your application without any unnecessary dependencies to the entire framework.

Juhta.NET is designed to support modern architectures. These architectures comprise such buzzwords as microservices, RESTful Web APIs, event sourcing etc.

Juhta.NET is completely free, now and in the future. The only driver for its development is the pure passion for software development and code writing without any goals for economic benefits whatsoever.

You may wonder what the word "juhta" means? It is a Finnish word and means "beast of burden" in English, that is, an animal such as a mule or donkey that is used for carrying loads. Therefore, in the application development world, it is a great metaphor for a solid and robust application framework running workloads. The word is also very close to the author’s first name, which gives it another association.
