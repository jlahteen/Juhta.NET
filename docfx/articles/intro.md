# Juhta.NET Introduction
------------------------
Juhta.NET is an open source, general-purpose app framework built on the top of .NET Core 2 (or later).

The basic idea of Juhta.NET is to provide a modular approach for the application development. You just choose those modules suitable for your application without any unnecessary dependencies to the entire framework.

Juhta.NET is designed to support modern architectures. These architectures comprise such buzzwords as microservices, RESTful Web APIs, event sourcing etc.

And, of course, Juhta.NET is free, now and in the future. The only driver for its development is the pure passion for software development and code writing without any goals for economic benefits whatsoever.

You may wonder what the word "juhta" means? It is a Finnish word and means "beast of burden" in English, that is, an animal such as a mule or donkey that is used for carrying loads. Therefore, in the application development world, it is a great metaphor for a solid and robust app framework running workloads. The word is also very close to the authorâ€™s first name, which gives it another association.

Juhta.NET has been designed for production use. However, as stated in the MIT license, the author has no liability of any kind of damage or any kind of problems that the production use may cause. Furthermore, Juhta.NET has no official support, but the author is more than willing to receive any kind of feedback, including bug reports.
