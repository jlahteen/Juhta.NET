# Juhta.NET

Content under construction.

Juhta.NET is an open source, general purpose app framework built on the top of .NET Core.

You may wonder what the word ”juhta” means? It’s a Finnish word and means “beast of burden” in English, that is, an animal such as a mule or donkey that is used for carrying loads. So in the application development world it's a metaphor for a solid and robust app framework. The word is also very close to the author’s first name which gives it another association.
