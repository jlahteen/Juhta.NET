# Welcome to Juhta.NET

Juhta.NET is an open-source, general-purpose application framework built on the top of .NET Core 2 and .NET Standard 2.

The basic idea of Juhta.NET is to provide a modular approach for the application development. You just choose those modules suitable for your application without any unnecessary dependencies to the entire framework. However, please note that the first release of Juhta.NET consists only of one library, the core library.

The future versions of Juhta.NET will be built to support modern architectures. These architectures comprise such buzzwords as microservices, RESTful Web APIs, event sourcing etc.

## Motivation

Juhta.NET is free, now and in the future. The only driver for its development is the pure passion for software development and code writing without any goals for economic benefits whatsoever.
