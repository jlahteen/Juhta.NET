# Welcome to Juhta.NET

Juhta.NET is an open-source, general-purpose application framework built on the top of .NET Core 2 and .NET Standard 2.

The basic idea of Juhta.NET is to provide a modular approach for the application development. You just choose those modules suitable for your application without any unnecessary dependencies to the entire framework.

Juhta.NET is designed to support modern architectures. These architectures comprise such buzzwords as microservices, RESTful Web APIs, event sourcing etc.

## Motivation

Juhta.NET is free, now and in the future. The main driver for its development is the pure passion for software development and code writing without any goals for economic benefits whatsoever.

The other important driver is that the author just wants to make himself and his current team more productive and also share this productivity toolbox in an open way.
